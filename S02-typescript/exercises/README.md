## TO DO: Typescript exercises 🎯

📍 **Exercise 1: Basic Types**
+ Create a variable with a string value and another with a number value.
+ Define a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

📍 **Exercise 2: Type Annotations**
+ Define a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. It should take two parameters: width and height, both of type number.
+ Create an interface for a Book with properties like title, author, and publication year.

📍 **Exercise 3: Interfaces and Objects**
+ Create an object that adheres to the Book interface you defined earlier.
+ Define a function that takes a Person object (with properties name and age) and returns a greeting message.

📍 **Exercise 4: Enumerations**
+ Create an enumeration for different days of the week.
+ Write a function that takes a DayOfWeek and returns a message indicating whether it's a working day or a weekend.

📍 **Exercise 5: Function Overloads**
+ Create a function that accepts either a number or a string and returns their length.
+ Define function overloads for the above function to handle both number and string inputs separately.

📍 **Exercise 6: Arrays and Generics**
+ Create an array of numbers and calculate their sum using the reduce method.
+ Write a function that takes an array and a value, and returns the index of the value in the array or -1 if not found.

📍 **Exercise 7: Classes and Inheritance**
+ Create a class Animal with properties name and age.
+ Create a subclass Dog that extends Animal and has an additional property breed.

📍 **Exercise 8: Decorators**
+ Write a decorator that logs the arguments and return value of a function when it's called.
+ Apply the decorator to a function and observe the logs when the function is executed.

📍 **Exercise 9: Type Inference**
+ Declare a variable with an initial value and don't specify its type. TypeScript should infer the type based on the value.

📍 **Exercise 10: Modules**
+ Create a module that exports functions for basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Import and use these functions in another file to perform calculations.
+ Build a module that fetches weather data from a weather API. Export functions to get current weather conditions and forecasts. Import these functions and display weather information in a console application.

📍 **Exercise 11: POO**
+ _Online Store:_ Build a basic online store with classes like Product, Cart, and Order. Implement methods to add products to the cart, place orders, and calculate the total cost.
+ _Geometry Calculator:_ Create a class for calculating geometric properties like area and perimeter. Implement methods for various shapes like circles, rectangles, triangles, etc.
+ _Library Catalog:_ Develop classes for books and authors. Create a library catalog that allows adding books, searching by author or title, and displaying information about available books.
